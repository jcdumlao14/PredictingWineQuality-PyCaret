## Introduction

Are you a wine enthusiast with a passion for data analysis? If so, you're in for a treat with the Wine Quality dataset. Created in 2009, this publicly available dataset contains information on the physicochemical properties of red and white wines, as well as their sensory data as rated by experts. With 11 input variables and an output attribute of wine quality rated on a scale of 0 to 10, this dataset can be viewed as a classification or regression task. In fact, several data mining methods were applied to this dataset, with the support vector machine model achieving the best results. As a wine lover, you'll be fascinated by the correlations between fixed and volatile acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol percentage, to name a few. The Wine Quality dataset has 6,497 instances, and because the classes are ordered and not balanced, outlier detection algorithms can be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. So, grab a bottle of Vinho Verde and let's explore the Wine Quality dataset!

## Goal

The goal is to use this dataset for research purposes, particularly in the fields of data mining, regression analysis, and feature selection.
